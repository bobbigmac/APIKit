What is APIKit?

The APIKit framework is a simple PHP application to host a RESTful API on your existing web site or application.

The APIKit outputs in JSON so can be easily consumed in the widest variety of platforms and languages with minimal overhead.

It also supports interconnectivity via triggers, allowing you to forward API calls on to other companies or your own remote instances of the APIKit, and receive triggered calls from other instances. This helps make direct B2B operations easy to setup and maintain.

A self-documenting configuration system ensures that all functions offered by your API are not only easy to configure and rollout, but they’re also easy to discover, understand, and use for all your API consumers.

The main benefits of the APIKit are:

    Automate complex business process across multiple servers and/or companies
    Self-documenting specification model builds great documentation automatically
    Widely supported and simple PHP for easy expansion of the framework
    Low API setup costs due to minimal integration requirements with your existing systems
    Automated distribution/visibility of your services via central registration
    Easy to change and maintain
    Lightweight implementation minimises resource requirements

The APIKit is licensed under Attribution-Share Alike 3.0. To use the framework you must share any changes or improvements you make so the wider community may benefit, and you must provide attribution in the form of a link to https://github.com/bobbigmac/APIKit on your API documentation page.

In addition, it would be greatly appreciated (though not essential) if you use the APIKit to host services for your company or website, that you announce it’s use and spread the word that creating an API to your data need not be complicated or expensive.

The underlying ideology of the APIKit is covered best by Tim Berners-Lee in his awesome TED Talks presentation: Raw Data Now. There is an endless underbelly of data out there going to waste simply because most organisations cannot spend the time and resources to make it available via ‘pretty’ user interfaces.

Well now, it’s easy: add the APIKit to your server and let other developers make it available for you :)
